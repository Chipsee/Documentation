GPIO

|Product| features a |gpio_conn| that provides 8 x opto-isolated GPIO pins, of which 4 x are output, and 4 x are input pins.

The GPIO **HIGH** output level corresponds to the voltage connected at the isolated Power Input, while the GPIO **LOW** output level corresponds to the isolated Ground Input. 

The GPIO uses the 24V logic by default. You can use an external isolated power input but the power input range should be from 5V to 24V DC.

.. attention::

    #) In order to use the Isolated Output, you need to add an external Isolated Power to the VDD_ISO and GND_ISO. The power voltage should not exceed 24V.
    #) The output current can supply 500mA for every channel, but it also depends on the isolated power that is connected.
    #) In order to use the Isolated Input, you need to add a signal to the InputX and GND_ISO. A 2.4KΩ resistor has been added to limit the input current, as shown in the figure below. This resistor should work well for the 5-24V input signal. If your input signal is less than 5V, please change this input resistor. The reduced schematic is for reference purpose, if you need the precise resistor schematic, please contact us.
    #) If the isolation is not a requirement, it is possible to use a non-isolated PSU instead. It is also possible to use the onboard 5V power supply: it can be re-routed to the *Isolated Power Input* pin by populating two PCB resistor footprints with 0Ω resistors. In this case, the *Isolated Power Input* pin will become an output for the onboard 5V power supply.
