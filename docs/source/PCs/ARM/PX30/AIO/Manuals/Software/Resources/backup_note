.. |note1| replace:: More on the prebuilt image: the core idea of backup is to "swap" your data and the prebuilt data. So we will need to download a prebuilt image that you're developing your software on (the OS image that you're currently using on the Chipsee PC), unpack that image, swap the data, then repack the image (imagine the old time people use a WinPE USB stick to boot and backup Windows!).

.. |note2| replace:: We will use the prebuilt-xxx-emmc-xx.img (eMMC firmware) to boot the device from an SD card, but the image for eMMC has one known bug: it will need reboot a few times to get the SD partition to be mounted on “/”. We will released one new image for SD called prebuilt-xxx-sd-xx.img in the future. But at the moment we can still get by with the eMMC image in an SD card.

.. |backup_reboot| replace:: Insert this SD card into the SD slot of the Chipsee PC and power it on, the Chipsee PC will boot into the system on the SD card (may need to reboot multiple times to boot from SD card, because of a known bug in the eMMC firmware, we will release a firmware for SD card in the future), we can use this system to backup the whole contents on eMMC rootfs partitions.
