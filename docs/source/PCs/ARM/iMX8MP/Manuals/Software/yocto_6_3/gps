If your product shipped with a GPS module, and a GPS antenna, you can enable the GPS function.

You can check the Chipsee *hardware test* program, click **GPS Enable** button, you should see some random code(GPS information) in the text box.

  *Click GPS Enable Button in Hardware Test*

You can also use GPS from command line.

Test the GPS function as follows, first, you listen to the GPS info serial port (/dev/ttyUSB5), then, you send AT commands to AT serial port (/dev/ttyUSB6). Finally, GPS information should appear on the info port. This means you will need two terminals opened, one for listening and the other for sending.

**GPS Port**: /dev/ttyUSB5

**AT port**: /dev/ttyUSB6

In the first terminal, we use **cat** to listen for GPS info:

.. code-block:: bash

   cat /dev/ttyUSB5 
   # hit Enter, the port will keep listening 
   # until any information comes to the port(after you send AT command to AT port)

In the second terminal, we send AT commands with micromcom, you can also use other programs to send serial commands:

.. code-block:: bash
   
   microcom /dev/ttyUSB6 -s 9600

   ATE1 # Enable displaying. Hit Enter after you type ATE1
   ATI # Print product info
   AT+CSQ # Query Signal Level, return [+CSQ: current signal strength, channel bit error rate] e.g.: +CSQ: 19,99 means strength 19 with rate 99
   AT+QGPSCFG="gpsnmeatype",31 # Turn on all output type, GGA/RMC/GSV/GSA/VTG, this setting will be saved to NVRAM, persists after reboot
   AT+QGPS=1 # enable GPS, wait some minutes, you can get data from terminal.
   AT+QGPSEND # disable GPS
