Backlight
---------

We use one PWM to control the backlight of |chip| boards, You can use the following commands:

* Get the supported max brightness:
    .. code-block:: bash

        cat /sys/class/backlight/backlight/max_brightness

* Get the current brightness:
    .. code-block:: bash

        cat /sys/class/backlight/backlight/actual_brightness

* Set brightness:
    .. code-block:: bash

        echo 50 > /sys/class/backlight/backlight/brightness

:pagebreak:`True`
