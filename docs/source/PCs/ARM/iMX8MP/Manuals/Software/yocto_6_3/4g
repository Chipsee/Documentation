4G/LTE
******

For products shipped with a 4G/LTE module, you can use the **quectel-CM** tool to configure 4G/LTE network.

.. note::

   SIM card **does not** support hot plug, **power off** before inserting/removing SIM card. 

In the Chipsee *hardware test* program, there is a **4G Enable** button, you can test the 4G function with this first. Then you can click "Netinfo" button, or "Refresh" button to check the 4G/LTE status.

To check available commands and help:

.. code-block:: bash

   quectel-CM --help

To connect with an APN, there are 3 pre-configured APN profiles, 3gnet/ctnet/cmnet, and a "custom" that you can configure yourself.

To connect to an APN, e.g.: ctnet

.. code-block:: bash

   quectel-CM -s ctnet

You can then ping an IP address to check you're connected, such as ping the Cloudflare DNS:

Then you need to set DNS server to resolve DNS.
