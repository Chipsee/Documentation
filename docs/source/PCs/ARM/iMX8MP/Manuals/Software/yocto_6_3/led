LED
---

There is a red LED beside PROG button, you can control the LED by writing a file:

.. code-block:: bash
	:linenos:
  	:emphasize-lines: 2, 7

	# Turn on the red LED
	root@imx8mp-eisd:/# echo 1 > /sys/class/leds/work/brightness
	root@imx8mp-eisd:/# cat /sys/class/leds/work/brightness
	1

	# Turn off the red LED
	root@imx8mp-eisd:/# echo 0 > /sys/class/leds/work/brightness
	root@imx8mp-eisd:/# cat /sys/class/leds/work/brightness
	0

You can use your programming language to control it as well. Simply use the file (IO) system library to write this **/sys/class/leds/work/brightness** file.
