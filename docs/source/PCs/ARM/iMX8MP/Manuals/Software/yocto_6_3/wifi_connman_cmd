WiFi(Command Line)
******************

This operating system uses `connmanctl` to set WiFi.

1. Enabling and disabling WiFi

   To check if WiFi is enabled you can run `connmanctl technologies` and check for the line that says `Powered: True/False`. 

   To power the WiFi on you can run `connmanctl enable wifi` or if you need to disable it you can run `connmanctl disable wifi`.

   .. code-block:: text
      :linenos:
      :emphasize-lines: 1, 23, 26

      root@imx8mp-eisd:~# connmanctl technologies
      /net/connman/technology/p2p
        Name = P2P
        Type = p2p
        Powered = False
        Connected = False
        Tethering = False
        TetheringFreq = 2412
      /net/connman/technology/ethernet
        Name = Wired
        Type = ethernet
        Powered = True
        Connected = False
        Tethering = False
        TetheringFreq = 2412
      /net/connman/technology/bluetooth
        Name = Bluetooth
        Type = bluetooth
        Powered = False
        Connected = False
        Tethering = False
        TetheringFreq = 2412
      /net/connman/technology/wifi
        Name = WiFi
        Type = wifi
        Powered = True
        Connected = True
        Tethering = False
        TetheringFreq = 2412

2. Connecting to an open access point

   To scan for nearby Wi-Fi networks: `connmanctl scan wifi`.

   To list the available networks found after a scan run (example output): 

   .. code-block:: text
      
      root@imx8mp-eisd:~# connmanctl services
      *AR Wired                ethernet_beec6e3af418_cable
      *A  chipsee              wifi_2cc3e64146b2_6a686f6d652d3032_managed_psk
          chipsee-5G           wifi_2cc3e64146b2_6a686f6d652d30325f3547_managed_psk
          13301                wifi_2cc3e64146b2_333031_managed_psk
          too                  wifi_2cc3e64146b2_7463746f6f6f_managed_psk

   To connect to an open network, use the second field beginning with `wifi_` (**tip: network names can be tab-completed.**): 

   .. code-block:: text

      connmanctl connect wifi_2cc3e64146b2_6a686f6d652d30325f3547_managed_psk

   You should now be connected to the network. Check using `connmanctl state` or `ip addr`. 

3. Connecting to a protected access point

   For protected access points you will need to provide some information to the ConnMan daemon, at the very least a password or a passphrase.

   The commands in this section show how to run `connmanctl` in interactive mode, it is required for running the agent command. To start interactive mode simply type: 

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ connmanctl

   You then proceed almost as above, first scan for any Wi-Fi technologies:

   .. code-block:: bash
   
      connmanctl> scan wifi

   To list services:

   .. code-block:: bash
   
      connmanctl> services

   Now you need to register the agent to handle user requests. The command is:

   .. code-block:: bash
   
      connmanctl> agent on

   You now need to connect to one of the protected services. To do this easily, just use tab completion for the wifi service. If you were connecting to Chipsee-5G in the example above you would type:

   .. code-block:: bash
   
      connmanctl> connect wifi_2cc3e64146b2_6a686f6d652d30325f3547_managed_psk

   The agent will then ask you to provide any information the daemon needs to complete the connection. The information requested will vary depending on the type of network you are connecting to. The agent will also print additional data about the information it needs as shown in the example below.

   .. code-block:: bash
   
      Agent RequestInput wifi_2cc3e64146b2_6a686f6d652d30325f3547_managed_psk
         Passphrase = [ Type=psk, Requirement=mandatory ]
         Passphrase?

   Provide the information requested, in this example the passphrase:

   To enable autoconnect after reboot:

   .. code-block:: bash

      config wifi_2cc3e64146b2_6a686f6d652d30325f3547_managed_psk autoconnect on

   And then type:

   .. code-block:: bash
      
      connmanctl> quit

   If the information you provided is correct you should now be connected to the protected access point. 

4. You can check the status with:

   .. code-block:: bash

      connmanctl services wifi_2cc3e64146b2_6a686f6d652d30325f3547_managed_psk

   It should give you:

   .. code-block:: text

      root@imx8mp-eisd:~# connmanctl services wifi_2cc3e64146b2_6a686f6d652d30325f3547_managed_psk

      /net/connman/service/wifi_2cc3e64146b2_6a686f6d652d30325f3547_managed_psk
        Type = wifi
        Security = [ psk, wps ]
        State = ready
        Strength = 48
        Favorite = True
        Immutable = False
        AutoConnect = True
        Name = chipsee-5G
        Ethernet = [ Method=auto, Interface=wlan0, Address=2C:C3:E6:41:46:B2, MTU=1500 ]
        IPv4 = [ Method=dhcp, Address=192.168.50.133, Netmask=255.255.255.0 ]
        IPv4.Configuration = [ Method=dhcp ]
        IPv6 = [ Method=auto, Address=fd35:e01d:6481:2645:2ec3:e6ff:fe41:46b2, PrefixLength=64, Privacy=disabled ]
        IPv6.Configuration = [ Method=auto, Privacy=disabled ]
        Nameservers = [ 8.8.8.8 192.168.50.1 ]
        Nameservers.Configuration = [  ]
        Timeservers = [  ]
        Timeservers.Configuration = [  ]
        Domains = [  ]
        Domains.Configuration = [  ]
        Proxy = [ Method=direct ]
        Proxy.Configuration = [  ]
        mDNS = False
        mDNS.Configuration = False
        Provider = [  ]

5. You should also be able to find a text config file of this WiFi's settings:

   .. code-block:: text

      root@imx8mp-eisd:~# cat /var/lib/connman/wifi_2cc3e64146b2_6a686f6d652d30325f3547_managed_psk/settings

      [wifi_2cc3e64146b2_6a686f6d652d30325f3547_managed_psk]
      Name=chipsee-5G
      SSID=6a686f6d652d30325f3547
      Frequency=5785
      Favorite=true
      AutoConnect=true
      Modified=2024-03-05T08:51:16Z
      Passphrase=password
      IPv4.method=dhcp
      IPv4.DHCP.LastAddress=192.168.50.133
      IPv6.method=auto
      IPv6.privacy=disabled

:pagebreak:`True`
