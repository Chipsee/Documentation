GPIO Port
--------------

|Product| has a 10 Pin 3.81mm **GPIO Connector**, as shown in the figure below.
The table below gives details about the definition of every Pin.

The VDD_ISO is a isolated power *input* pin, you should attach a 5~24V DC power input to this pin. 

It is also possible to use the onboard 5V power supply. The 5V on board power supply can be re-routed to the *Isolated Power Input* pin by populating R236 and R239 PCB footprints with 0â„¦ resistors **in the factory**. In this case you don't need to provide a DC power supply unit to use the GPIO, and the *VDD_ISO* input will become a *5V OUTPUT* powered by the on board 5V.

.. [#i] | If the isolation is not a requirement, it is possible to use a non-isolated PSU instead. 
        | Note that in this case, the *Isolated Power Input* pin will become an output for the onboard 5V power supply.

.. attention::

   + The GPIO has been Opt-Isolated and it uses the 24V Logic by default.
   + The 4 output channels can drive at most 500mA current on each channel.
