The offered CPU consumes very little power. From the ground-up, the CPU is built for low power consumption. As such, it is best suited for mobile and power-constrained industrial or field applications. A specially designed aluminum alloy housing with fins for increased heat dissipation serves as a passive cooler, eliminating the need for built-in fans. The fanless design reduces noise, as well as the maintenance costs and efforts, leading to increased reliability at the same time.

|Product| is based around the powerful i.MX8MP System on Chip (SoC), powered by the NXP i.MX8MP low-power processor which integrates a quad-core |Cortex|-A53 1.6GHz processor.

The i.MX8MP supports multi-format video decoders and has a high-performance |RAM| RAM capable of sustaining demanding memory bandwidths. It also provides a complete set of peripheral interfaces.
