Install an APK
==============

To install an app from your workstation to the |ipc|, we'll also need the help of **adb**.

You should download or compile an APK file you want to install on your workstation, put it in a folder you can find, such as Downloads folder.

For **MacOS and Linux** users, you can open a terminal window, connect to your |ipc| like explained in the previous chapter, but don't get into shell.

Let's say we have a copy of Jellyfin-Android apk in our Downloads folder: 

.. rst-class:: text-center

   .. image:: /Media/ARM/A55/Software/Android/Install_APK-1.png
      :align: center
      :width: 480

   *Prepare Your APK File*

Then we can type `adb install path-to-file` to install it to our |ipc|'s Android system. Take care of the relative file path, you can use a absolute path as well.

.. code:: bash

    adb install Downloads/jellyfin-android-v2.5.2-libre-release.apk

It might take a minute to get one app installed, you should see a **success** in the terminal after the installation is finished successfully.

.. rst-class:: text-center

   .. image:: /Media/ARM/A55/Software/Android/Install_APK-2.png
      :align: center
      :width: 640

   *Installation Finished After 1 Minute*

You can check the |ipc| from it's screen, and confirm your app is installed successfully:

.. rst-class:: text-center

   .. image:: /Media/ARM/A55/Software/Android/Install_APK-3.jpg
      :align: center
      :width: 640

   *The App We Just Installed is on our Android PC*
