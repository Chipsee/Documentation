.. |note1| replace:: More on the two prebuilt images: the core idea of backup is to "swap" your data and the prebuilt data. So we will need to download a prebuilt image that you're developing your software on (the OS image that you're currently using on the Chipsee PC), unpack that image, swap the data, then repack the image. 

.. |note2| replace:: As for the second prebuilt-xxx-sd-xx.img, we use it to make a bootable SD card (imagine the old time people use a WinPE USB stick to boot and backup Windows!).

.. |backup_reboot| replace:: Insert this SD card into the SD slot of the Chipsee PC and power it on, the Chipsee PC will boot into the system on the SD card, we can use this system to backup the whole contents on eMMC rootfs partitions.
