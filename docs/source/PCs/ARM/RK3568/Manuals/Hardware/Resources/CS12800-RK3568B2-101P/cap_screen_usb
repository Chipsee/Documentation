.. attention::

   A capacitive touch screen is susceptible to power noise and Electromagnetic Radiation (EMR). It may cause LCD ripples or even capacitive 
   touch malfunction. If using a capacitive multi-touch test application, you might notice the touch points float erratically across the display.

   There are several solutions to this problem:
      
   #) Use a high-quality Power Adapter Unit (PSU) with low EMR. You can also provide power from a battery.
   #) Make sure that the |product| metal case is properly connected to the Power System Ground to provide sufficient EMI shielding and eliminate the problem entirely.
