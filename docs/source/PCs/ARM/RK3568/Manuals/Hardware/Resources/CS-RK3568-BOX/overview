  + Industrial Automation
  + Process Control
  + Smart Grid Management
  + CNC Manufacturing
  + Environmental Monitoring
  + Predictive Maintenance

The offered CPU consumes very little power, around |pwr|. From the ground-up, the CPU is built for low power consumption. As such, it is best suited for mobile and power-constrained industrial or field applications. A specially designed aluminum alloy housing with fins for increased heat dissipation serves as a passive cooler, eliminating the need for built-in fans. The fanless design reduces noise, as well as the maintenance costs and efforts, leading to increased reliability at the same time.

|Product| is based around the powerful |rk_soc| System on Chip (SoC), powered by the Rockchip |rk_soc| low-power processor which integrates a quad-core |Cortex|-A55 2.0GHz processor.

The |rk_soc| supports multi-format video decoders and has a high-performance |RAM| RAM capable of sustaining demanding memory bandwidths. It also provides a complete set of peripheral interfaces.
