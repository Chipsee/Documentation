The offered CPU consumes very little power, around |pwr|. From the ground-up, the CPU is built for low power consumption. As such, it is best suited for mobile and power-constrained industrial or field applications. A specially designed aluminum alloy housing with fins for increased heat dissipation serves as a passive cooler, eliminating the need for built-in fans. The fanless design reduces noise, as well as the maintenance costs and efforts, leading to increased reliability at the same time.

|Product| is based around the powerful RK3588 System on Chip (SoC), powered by the Rockchip RK3588 low-power processor which integrates a Quad(4)-core |Cortex|-A76 (2.4GHz) and Quad(4)-core |Cortex|-A55 (1.8GHz) processor.

The RK3588 supports multi-format video decoders and has a high-performance |RAM| RAM capable of sustaining demanding memory bandwidths. It also provides a complete set of peripheral interfaces.
