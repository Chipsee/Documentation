Connectivity
============

There are many connectivity options available on the |product| industrial PC. It has |USB|, |LAN| (RJ45) Ethernet connector supporting up to 1 Gbps, and 5 x UART terminals (RS232/RS485), 2 x CAN FD.

RS232/RS485/CAN
---------------

The serial communication interfaces (RS485, RS232, and CAN FD) are routed to a **16-pin 3.81mm terminal**, as illustrated on the figure below.

Serial communication on both RS485 and RS232 interfaces can reach up to 115200 kbps.

.. attention::

    #) The 120Ω match resistor for the CAN bus is NOT mounted by default.
    #) The 120Ω match resistor for the RS485 is mounted by default.
    #) RS485_3, RS485_4 and RS485_5 can control the input and output direction automatically. There’s no need to control it from within the software.
