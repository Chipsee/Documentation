Connectivity
============

There are many connectivity options available on the |product| industrial PC. It has |USB|, 1 x network connector (RJ45) supporting up to 1 Gbps, 8 x GPIO, 2 x CAN FD and 4 x UART terminals (RS232/485).

RS232/RS485/CAN
---------------

The serial communication interfaces (RS485, RS232, and CAN FD) are routed to a **24-pin 3.81mm terminal**, as illustrated in the figure below.

Serial communication on both RS485 and RS232 interfaces can reach up to 115200 kbps.



.. attention::

   #) The 120Ω match resistor for **CAN** bus is **NOT mounted** by default.
   #) The 120Ω match resistor for **RS485** is **NOT mounted** by default.
   #) RS485_3 and RS485_4 can control the input and output direction automatically. There’s no need to control it from within the software.
   #) This product supports changing 2 x RS485 to 2 x RS232, supports changing 2 x CAN to 2 x RS232, providing up to 6 x RS232 (including one debug port).
