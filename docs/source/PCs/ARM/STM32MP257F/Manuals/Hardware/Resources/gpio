GPIO Port
---------

|Product| features a |gpio_conn| that provides 8 x opto-isolated GPIO pins, of which 4 x are output, and 4 x are input pins. 
The terminal also includes an isolated PSU input in the range of 5 to 24 VDC. The exact pinout is given in follow table.

The GPIO **HIGH** output level corresponds to the voltage connected at the isolated Power Input, while the GPIO **LOW** output level corresponds to the 
isolated Ground Input. Each GPIO output can drive loads up to 500mA, enough to drive various applications directly, such as relays or solenoid valves.

.. include:: /PCs/Shared/Hardware/gpio_image

.. attention::

   + If the isolation is not a requirement, it is possible to use a non-isolated PSU instead on the Isolated Power Input.
   + The GPIO has been Opt-Isolated and it uses the 24V Logic by default.
   + The 4 output channels can drive at most 500mA current on each channel.
