Setting Static IP
-----------------

WiFi
****

If you are using WiFi with the **/lib/systemd/network/51-wireless.network** file as configuration file, open it, update it to:

.. code-block:: bash

   [Match]
   Name=wlan0
   [Network]
   DNS=192.168.50.1
   Address=192.168.50.212/24
   Gateway=192.168.50.1

**DNS, Address, Gateway** should be different from yours, set them to the values you need it to be.

Then,

.. code-block:: bash

   systemctl restart systemd-networkd.service

Ethernet
********

If you are using Ethernet with the **/lib/systemd/network/80-wired.network** file as configuration file, open it, remove [DHCP] section, update the [network] section, like:

.. code-block:: bash
  
   [Match]
   Type=ether
   Name=!veth*
   KernelCommandLine=!nfsroot
   KernelCommandLine=!ip

   [Network]
   DNS=192.168.50.1
   Address=192.168.50.213/24
   Gateway=192.168.50.1

**DNS, Address, Gateway** should be different from yours, set them to the values you need it to be.

Then,

.. code-block:: bash

   systemctl restart systemd-networkd.service

Revert to DHCP
**************

To reverse to using **DHCP**:

WiFi - /lib/systemd/network/51-wireless.network:

.. code-block:: bash
   
   [Match]
   Name=wlan0
   [Network]
   DHCP=ipv4


Ethernet - /lib/systemd/network/80-wired.network:

.. code-block:: bash

   [Match]
   Type=ether
   Name=!veth*
   KernelCommandLine=!nfsroot
   KernelCommandLine=!ip

   [Network]
   DHCP=yes

   [DHCP]              
   UseMTU=yes          
   RouteMetric=10      
   ClientIdentifier=mac
