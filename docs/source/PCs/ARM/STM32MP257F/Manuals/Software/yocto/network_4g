4G/LTE
------

For products shipped with a 4G/LTE module, you can use Chipsee *hardwaretest* program and the **quectel-CM** tool to configure 4G/LTE network.

.. note::

   SIM card **does not** support hot plug, **power off** before inserting/removing SIM card. 

In the Chipsee *hardware test* program, there is a **4G Enable** button, you can test the 4G function with this first. Then you can click "Netinfo" button, or "Refresh" button to check the 4G/LTE status.

To connect with an APN, there are 3 pre-configured APN profiles, 3gnet/ctnet/cmnet, and a "custom" that you can configure yourself.

  *4G/LTE Hardware Test Program*

The Yocto Linux system pre-installed **quectel-CM** command, check available commands of **quectel-CM** and help:

.. code-block:: bash

   quectel-CM --help

To connect to an APN, e.g.: 3gnet

.. code-block:: bash

   quectel-CM -s 3gnet

The program should acquire an IP address from your carrier automatically.
