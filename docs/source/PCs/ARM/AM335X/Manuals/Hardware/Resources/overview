|Product| is based around the powerful CS-SOM335X-V3 System on Module (SoM), powered by the AM3354 |Arm| |Cortex|-A8 microprocessor unit (MPU). The AM33554 MPU is enhanced with image, graphics processing, peripherals and industrial interface options such as EtherCAT and PROFIBUS. The devices support high-level operating systems (HLOS).

The microprocessor unit (MPU) subsystem is based on the ARM Cortex-A8 processor and the PowerVR SGX™ Graphics Accelerator subsystem provides 3D graphics acceleration to support display and gaming effects.

The AM33554 MPU does not generate extensive heat, so even the thin aluminum housing on PPC version delivers sufficient thermal dissipation.
