We will compress the img file to img.xz file which will reduce file size in future and save time to download it to use. 
But we need decompress it to img file when we use `RKDevtool <https://chipsee-tmp.s3.amazonaws.com/mksdcardfiles/RK3399/Tools/MID_RK3399_UpdateTool_v2.58.zip>`_ to download it to target board.
Don't know how to reflash OS? There is one PDF guide in the RKDevtool packages for you to refer to reflash OS.
if the file you downloaded is img file, ignore it.
