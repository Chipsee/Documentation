.. |note2| replace:: We will use the prebuilt-xxx-emmc-xx.img (eMMC firmware) to boot the device from an SD card (imagine the old time people use a WinPE USB stick to boot and backup Windows!), but the image for eMMC has one known bug: it will need reboot a few times to get the SD partition to be mounted on “/”. We will release one new image for SD called prebuilt-xxx-sd-xx.img in the future. But at the moment we can still get by with the eMMC image in an SD card. (For *7 inch RK3399(EPC/PPC-A72-070-C)* user, you can select prebuilt-xxx-sd-xx.img now.)
