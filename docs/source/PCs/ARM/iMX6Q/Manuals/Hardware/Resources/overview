|Product| is based around the powerful CS-SOM-iMX6Q System on Module (SoM), powered by the i.MX6Q |Arm| |Cortex|-A9 quad-core Application Processor (APU). The i.MX6Q APU represents the latest achievement in integrated multimedia applications processors, delivering high-performance computing, an abundance of integrated peripherals, and high power efficiency. 

This product also features a broad range of connectivity options, providing a high level of scalability for various use cases. It is the perfect solution for power-constrained applications on the Edge, acting as a robust control unit for collecting, processing, and aggregating field data. The 
i.MX6Q APU is part of NXP's EdgeVerse™ edge computing platform.

The NXP i.MX6UL APU does not generate extensive heat, so even the thin aluminum housing on PPC version delivers sufficient thermal dissipation. With its junction temperature from -40 to +125°C, the APU itself is well suited for extended temperature range in both automotive and factory environments.
