Power Input
===========

|Product| can be powered by a wide range of input voltages: from 6 to 36V DC. The power input connector is a **3-pin, 3.81mm terminal**. 
The polarity and the pinout is clearly marked on the housing of the PPC version, as well as on the PCB itself of the EPC version, as shown
in *Figure 1*.

Note that the "**+**" sign represents the positive power input, and it is printed both at the casing and as a silk-screen on a PCB of the embedded version. The "**-**" terminal is shorted to the ground.
