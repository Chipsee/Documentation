Boot DIP Switch
===============

|Product| supports boot from SD card. If you want to re-flash the Operating System (OS), you can use the TF card for that purpose, combined with
the **DIP switch** settings.

There is no need to alter the DIP switch settings during regular operation. However, if you need to reinstall the OS, please refer to the table below.
Detailed information on how to re-flash the OS can be found in the :ref:`Software Documentation <IMX6Q_OS>`.
