|Product| offers a very low power consumption, despite its high-speed processing capabilities. It is powered by the i.MX6UL |Arm| |Cortex|-A7, an ultra-low power Application Processor Unit (APU) from NXP, running at up to 528 MHz. 

This product also features a broad range of connectivity options, providing a high level of scalability for various use cases. It is the perfect solution for power-constrained applications on the Edge, acting as a robust control unit for collecting, processing, and aggregating field data. The 
i.MX6Q APU is part of NXP's EdgeVerse™ edge computing platform.

The NXP i.MX6UL APU does not generate extensive heat, so even the thin aluminum housing on PPC version delivers sufficient thermal dissipation. With its junction temperature from -20 to +140°C, the APU itself is well suited for extended temperature range in both automotive and factory environments.
