.. attention::

   A capacitive touch screen is susceptible to power noise and Electromagnetic Radiation (EMR). It may cause LCD ripples or even capacitive 
   touch malfunction. If using a capacitive multitouch test application, you might notice the touch points float erratically across the display. 
   There are several solutions to this problem:
      
   #) Use a high-quality Power Adapter Unit (PSU) with low EMR. You can also provide power from a battery.
   #) Make sure that the |product| Power Input connector (pin 3) is properly connected to the Power System Ground to provide sufficient EMI 
      shielding and eliminate the problem entirely.
   #) Bad GND problem can also be confirmed by touching pin 3 of the Power Input connector with one hand while operating the capacitive touch screen
      with the other hand. In this case, the operator's body acts as the Power System Ground.
