Power Input
===========

|Product| can be powered by a wide range of input voltages: |vin_rng| DC. There are two types of power input connectors. One is a **3 Pin, 3.81mm screw terminal** connector, and the other is a **2.1mm DC input head**.
The polarity and the pinout is clearly marked on the housing of the |productP| version, as well as on the board itself of the |productE| version, as shown
in the figures below.
