Connectivity
============

There are many connectivity options available on the |product| industrial Pi PC. It has |USB|, |LAN| (RJ45) Ethernet connector supporting up to 1 Gbps, and 4 x UART and 1 x CAN terminals (RS232/RS485/CAN).


RS232/RS485/CAN
---------------

The serial communication interfaces (RS485, RS232, and CAN) are routed to a |rs232_485_can_ter|, as illustrated in the figure below.

.. attention::

   #) RS485_3 and RS485_5 can control the input and output direction automatically. There’s no need to control it from within the software.
   #) The 120Ω match resistor for the RS485 and CAN bus are **NOT** mounted by default. Be sure to mount the match resistor when testing CAN.
