From the ground-up, the CPU is built for low power consumption, around |pwr|. As such, it is best suited for mobile and power-constrained industrial or field applications. A specially designed aluminum alloy housing with fins for increased heat dissipation serves as a passive cooler, eliminating the need for built-in fans. The fanless design reduces noise, as well as the maintenance costs and efforts, leading to increased reliability at the same time.

|Product| is based around the powerful Raspberry |Pi| Compute Module 4, powered by the Quad |Cortex|-A72 processor with a processor speed of 1.5GHz.
