    #) In order to use the Isolated Output, you need to add an external Isolated Power to the VDD_ISO and GND_ISO. The power voltage should not exceed 24V.
    #) The output current can achieve 500mA for every channel, but it also depends on the isolated power that is connected.
    #) In order to use the Isolated Input, you need to add a signal to the ISO_InputX and GND_ISO. A 2.4KÎ© resistor, as R6, can be added to limit the input current, as shown in the figure above. This resistor should work well for the 5-24V input signal. If your input signal is less than 5V, please change this input resistor.
