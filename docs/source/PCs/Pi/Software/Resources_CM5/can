CAN Bus
-------

There is one CAN bus on the |chip| based |ipc|. You can install `can-utils` and use them to test CAN. But you must add one 120Ω resistor between CAN_H and CAN_L on one of the two Boards, as shown on the figure below.

.. note::

  The Chipsee IPC does not mount the 120Ω matched resistor on all CAN signals by default.

  Connecting CAN

Here are a few examples to test CAN by using CAN units.

* Install `can-utils` if you haven't.
  
  .. code:: bash

    $ sudo apt install can-utils

* Set the bit-rate to **1Mbits/sec** and data rate to **8Mbits/sec** using the following command (use ROOT user):
  
  .. code:: bash

    $ sudo ip link set can0 down
    $ sudo ip link set can0 up type can bitrate 1000000 dbitrate 8000000 restart-ms 1000 berr-reporting on fd on

  .. note::

    If you see:

    *RTNETLINK answers: Connection timed out*

    Make sure to mount the 120Ω matched resistor.

* Bring up the device using the command:
  
  .. code:: bash

    $ sudo ip link set can0 up

* Transfer packets
  
  .. code:: bash

    $ sudo cansend can0 5A1#11.2233.44556677.88

* Receive data from CAN bus
  
  .. code:: bash

    $ sudo candump can0

* Bring down the device

  .. code:: bash

    $ sudo ip link set can0 down
