GNSS/GPS
--------

GPS is integrated in the CAT-4 4G/LTE Quectel EC25 module, if your product comes with the CAT-4 module, and a GPS antenna, you can enable the GPS feature.

You can test with the *Chipsee hardware test* program, click **GPS Enable** button, you should see some random code(GPS information) in the text box. Wait a few minutes for GPS to become stable.

  *Click GPS Enable*

You can also use GPS programmatically with serial port.

GPS Port: **/dev/ttyUSB1**

AT port: **/dev/ttyUSB2**

In the first terminal, we use cat to listen for GPS info:

.. code-block:: bash

  cat /dev/ttyUSB1
  # hit Enter, the port will keep listening
  # until any information comes to the port(after you send AT command to AT port)

In the second terminal, send AT instructions:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ microcom –s 9600 -p /dev/ttyUSB2
  ATE1 # Enable displaying. Hit Enter after you type ATE1
  AT+QGPSCFG="gpsnmeatype",31 # Turn on all output type, GGA/RMC/GSV/GSA/VTG, this setting will be saved to NVRAM, persists after reboot
  AT+QGPS=1 # enable GPS, wait some minutes, you can get data from terminal.

.. note::

  Ensure the antenna has clear view of the sky — GPS needs time to acquire satellites (can take 30s–2min cold start).
