GNSS/GPS
--------

GPS is integrated in the CAT-1 SIM7670G-MNSV module and CAT-4 Quectel EC25 4G/LTE module, if your product comes with one of these module, and a GPS antenna, you can enable the GPS feature.

GPS (CAT-4 Module)
******************

You can test with the *Chipsee hardware test* program, click **GPS Enable** button, you should see some random code(GPS information) in the text box. Wait a few minutes for GPS to become stable.

  *Click GPS Enable*

You can also use GPS programmatically with serial port.

GPS Port: **/dev/ttyUSB1**

AT port: **/dev/ttyUSB2**

In the first terminal, we use cat to listen for GPS info:

.. code-block:: bash

  cat /dev/ttyUSB1
  # hit Enter, the port will keep listening
  # until any information comes to the port(after you send AT command to AT port)

In the second terminal, send AT instructions:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ microcom –s 9600 -p /dev/ttyUSB2
  ATE1 # Enable displaying. Hit Enter after you type ATE1
  AT+QGPSCFG="gpsnmeatype",31 # Turn on all output type, GGA/RMC/GSV/GSA/VTG, this setting will be saved to NVRAM, persists after reboot
  AT+QGPS=1 # enable GPS, wait some minutes, you can get data from terminal.

.. note::

  Ensure the antenna has clear view of the sky — GPS needs time to acquire satellites (can take 30s–2min cold start).

  *Read GPS from AT Command and NMEA Stream*

To disable GPS:

.. code-block:: bash

  AT+QGPSEND # disable GPS

To exit microcom:

.. code-block:: bash

  # Press:
  # Ctrl + \
  # Followed by:
  quit

GPS (CAT-1 Module)
******************

You can use GPS programmatically with serial port on the SIM7670G-MNSV module.

GPS port: **/dev/ttyACM0**

AT port: **/dev/ttyACM0**

Serial port connection: Baudrate 9600 @ 8-N-1.

You can use the CuteCom program to test AT commands:

.. code-block:: bash

  AT+SIMCOMATI # Check CAT-1 module info.
 
  AT+CGNSSPWR=1 # Enable GPS. Command is not persisted across reboot.
  
  AT+CGNSSINFO # Query GPS infomation

After each AT command to query GPS, one response is returned.

.. note::

  Ensure the antenna has clear view of the sky — GPS needs time to acquire satellites (can take 30s–2min cold start).
