Boot Switch Configuration
-------------------------

Chipsee RPC supports booting from an integrated eMMC or an external TF Card (also known as the micro SD card).

.. note::

    CS12800RA4101A and CS12800RA4101P only supports eMMC boot

The Compute Module (CM) version will determine the boot modes your product supports.
If you use CM with eMMC, you can only use eMMC boot. If you use CM Lite which has no eMMC, you can only use SD boot. |br|
To boot from the SD Card, you must place the SD Card in **SD0** slot. You can use the **SD1** slot as external storage.


For **CS10600RA070**, **CS12800RA101**, and **CS10600RA4070** products, you can download a new system to eMMC by: configuring the boot switch to USB position, inserting Mini-B USB cable, and then power the board. This will enable eMMC to work as a USB storage. |br|
After the eMMC flash, you need to configure the boot switch to the eMMC position again. |br|
If you need to use SD boot, you should configure the boot switch to the eMMC position.


For the **CS12800RA4101A** product, you can download a new system to eMMC by: inserting a Micro-B USB cable, pressing the VOL+ button, and then power the board to enable eMMC to work as a USB storage. If you use C111 Version, you should press Boot Mode button. |br|

For the **CS12800RA4101P** product, you can download a new system to eMMC by: inserting a Micro-B USB cable, pressing the Boot DIP button, and then power the board to enable eMMC to work as a USB storage. |br|

The next sections explain in detail the steps in downloading a new system to eMMC.

Prebuilt image
--------------

Chipsee Raspberry Pi products use the Raspberry Pi official system as a base and add some modules and drivers. You can get the driver and latest image by referring to `<https://github.com/Chipsee/industrial-pi#latest-system-images>`_. |br|
If you’re not using balenaEtcher, you’ll need to unzip the `.img.xz` file and get the image file `(.img)` to write to your SD card.

Writing images to the SD Card
-----------------------------

Before you start, don’t forget to check your SD card size (at least 16GB). |br|
You will need to use an image writing tool to install the downloaded image on your SD card.

**Using balenaEtcher Tool** |br|

*balenaEtcher* is a graphical SD card writing tool that works on Mac OS, Linux and Windows, and is the easiest option for most users.
balenaEtcher also supports writing images directly from the .img.xz file, without any unzipping required. |br|
To write your image with balenaEtcher, follow these steps:

* Download and install the latest version of `balenaEtcher <https://www.balena.io/etcher/>`_.
* Connect an SD card reader with the SD card inside.
* Open balenaEtcher and select from your hard drive the Raspberry Pi® .img.xz file you want to write to the SD card.
* Select the SD card you want to write your image to.
* Review your selections and click ‘Flash!’ to begin writing data to the SD card.
    .. note::

        For Linux users, **zenity** might need to be installed on your machine for balenaEtcher to be able to write the image on your SD card.

Writing images to the eMMC
--------------------------

Before you start, don’t forget to check your eMMC size, and select one image. You also need to install :download:`rpiboot <https://github.com/raspberrypi/usbboot/raw/master/win32/rpiboot_setup.exe>` to enable eMMC to work as one USB storage in your PC. |br|
Under Windows, an installer is available to install the required drivers and boot tool automatically.|br|
For those who just want to enable the Compute Module eMMC as a mass storage device under Windows, the stand-alone installer is the recommended option.

The write images to the eMMC, follow these steps:

* Download and run the Windows installer **rpitools** to install the drivers and boot tool.
* For **CS10600RA070**, **CS12800RA101**, and **CS10600RA4070** products, plug your host PC Mini-B USB into the USB Downloader port, making sure the boot switch is set to the USB position.
* For **CS12800RA4101A** product, plug your host PC Micro-B USB into the USB Slave port (can be also called USB Download Port), press and hold the VOL+ button, if you use C111 Version, press Boot Mode button.
* For **CS12800RA4101P** product, plug your host PC Micro-B USB into the USB Slave port (can be also called USB Download Port), press and hold the Boot DIP button.
* Power ON the board. Windows should now find the hardware and install the driver. For CS12800RA4101A and CS12800RA4101P, you can release the button now.
* Once the driver installation is complete, run the **RPiBoot.exe** tool that was previously installed. You can run **RPiBoot.exe** in Windows PowerShell, as shown on the figure below.

* After a few seconds, the Compute Module eMMC will pop up under Windows as a disk (USB mass storage device).
* Refer to `Writing images to the SD Card`_ to flash system to eMMC (like the SD card in Windows).
* If process completes, power OFF the board and ensure the boot switch is set to eMMC position. Power ON to use the new system. |br| For **CS12800RA4101A**, ignore repositioning the boot switch, a reboot will be ok. |br| To learn more, visit the following link: `<https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/hardware/computemodule/cm-emmc-flashing.md>`_

Booting from the external TF Card allows flashing the system OS.

.. note::
    The operator should use the prebuilt file we provided in the CD to test the hardware before re-flashing the system.
