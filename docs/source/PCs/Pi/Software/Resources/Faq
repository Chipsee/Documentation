How to Rotate the Touch
-----------------------

Display can be rotated from the GUI, but the touch layer needs to be rotated manually.

.. code:: bash

  $ sudo vi /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/40-libinput.conf
  # inside 40-libinput.conf
  # Move to the Section of "Identifier .... touchscreen ...."
  # Add this line inside the Section/EndSection:
  Option "TransformationMatrix" "0 1 0 -1 0 1 0 0 1"

Then the touch will be rotated permanently after reboot. You can also undo this line to rotate it back.
