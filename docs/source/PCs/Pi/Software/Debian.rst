Preparation
===========

You will need to prepare the following items before you can start using the Prebuilt Images Package to re-flash the system.

Power Supply Unit (PSU) with the appropriate voltages, as follows:

+ These products: CS12720RA4050, CS10600RA070, CS10600RA4070, CS10600RA4070P-D, CSRA4BOX and CS12800RA101 requires a 6V to 36V power adapter. You must provide the power adapter since Chipsee does not ship these products with a power adapter.
+ The CS12800RA4101A RPC needs a 12V power adapter. Chipsee provides the power adapter.
+ The CS12800RA4101P, CS10768RA4121, CS19108RA4133, CS10768RA4150, CS19108RA4156, CS19108RA4215, CS19108RA4236 RPC need 12V to 36V power adapter.
