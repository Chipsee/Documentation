Zigbee Module
-------------

|Product| supports an onboard Zigbee module. The Zigbee controller is TI CC2531, and the Raspberry Pi forum supports it. |br| |br|
For |productP|, there is a connector on the backside of the case that you can use to connect the external Zigbee antenna, as described in the figure below. If you need to use WiFi/BT and Zigbee together, we can customized the case and add another SMA connector for you, usually across the rear to the opposite of the current SMA.
