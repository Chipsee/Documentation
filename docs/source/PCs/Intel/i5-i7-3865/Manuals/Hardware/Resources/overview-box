Product Overview
=================

The |product| is a rugged, high-quality mountable multifunctional industrial PC without a display. Thanks to the integrated brackets and its light-weight construction, it can be firmly attached to any flat surface, such as industrial cabinets or walls.

|product| is powered by the high-performance |Intel| |Core| i7 10510U quad-core (8 threads) CPU, but it can be scaled down to i5 10210U or |Celeron| 3855U, depending on  application requirements. |Product| also features a broad range of connectivity options, allowing it to meet even the most demanding requirements in harsh industrial or outdoor environments.

Despite their cutting-edge performances, the offered CPUs consume very little power: their TDP is only 15W at respective base clock frequencies. From the ground-up, these CPUs are built for low power consumption. As such, they are best suited for mobile and power-constrained industrial or field applications.

A specially designed aluminum alloy housing with fins for increased heat dissipation serves as a passive cooler, eliminating the need for built-in fans. 
The fan-less design reduces noise, as well as the maintenance costs and efforts, increasing reliability at the same time.

.. caution::

   Be careful when handling the product while it is operating: it might become hot under heavy CPU load.
