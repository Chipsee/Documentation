Despite their cutting-edge performances, the offered CPUs consume very little power: their TDP is only 15W at respective base clock frequencies. From the ground-up, these CPUs are built for low power consumption. As such, they are best suited for mobile and power-constrained industrial or field applications.

A specially designed magnesium-aluminum alloy housing with fins for increased heat dissipation serves as a passive cooler, eliminating the need for built-in fans. 
The fan-less design reduces noise, as well as the maintenance costs and efforts, increasing reliability at the same time.

.. caution::

   Be careful when handling the product while it is operating: the back panel might become hot under heavy CPU load.
