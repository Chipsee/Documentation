The offered CPU consumes very little power: its TDP is only 10W at the base clock frequency. From the ground-up, the CPU is built for low power consumption. As such, it is best suited for mobile and power-constrained industrial or field applications.

A specially designed aluminum alloy housing with fins for increased heat dissipation serves as a passive cooler, eliminating the need for built-in fans.
The fanless design reduces noise, as well as the maintenance costs and efforts, leading to increased reliability at the same time.

.. caution::

   Be careful when handling the product while it is operating: it might become hot under heavy CPU load.
