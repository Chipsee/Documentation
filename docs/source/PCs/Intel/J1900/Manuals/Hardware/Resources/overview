|Product| is powered by |Intel| |Celeron| J1900 quad-core CPU and equipped with a broad range of connectivity options, allowing it to meet highly demanding 
application requirements in harsh industrial or outdoor environments.

A specially designed magnesium-aluminum alloy housing with fins for increased heat dissipation serves as a passive cooler, eliminating the need for built-in fans. 
The fan-less design reduces noise, as well as the maintenance costs and efforts, increasing reliability at the same time.

.. caution::

   Be careful when handling the product while it is operating: the back panel might become hot under heavy CPU load.
