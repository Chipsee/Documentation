============

There are many connectivity options available on the |product| industrial PC. It has 4 x USB Type A connectors configured as HOSTS, 1 x HDMI port, 2 x RJ45 connectors supporting 
Gigabit Ethernet (GbE), and up to 4 x RS232 connectors, of which two can be configured in the RS485 mode. There are also 8 x GPIO channels for various user-defined purposes.

RS232/485/GPIO Connectors
-------------------------

|Product| has 2 x 9-pin D-sub connectors and 1 x 16-pin 3.81mm connector with pluggable terminal block *(Figure 2)*. Two 9-pin D-sub connectors labeled as **COM1** and **COM2** can 
be configured either as RS232 or RS485 communication interfaces.

The bottom row of terminals on the terminal block is labeled as **COM3/4**. These terminals are configured as two additional RS232 interfaces by default. The upper row of 
terminals on the terminal block represents eight **GPIO** channels, labeled as **GPIO (0 ... 7)**.
