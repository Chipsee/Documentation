Power Input
===========

|Product| can be powered by a wide range of input voltages: from 9V to 30V DC. The power input connector is a 2-pin, 3.81mm screw terminal *(Figure 1)*.
The polarity of the power connector is clearly labeled on the housing itself: the '**+**' sign is the positive, while the '**-**' sign is the negative power supply input.

The **POWER** button is located next to the power input connector and can be used to switch the power ON or OFF.

The power input section of |product| features a range of protection features, including over-current, over-voltage, power surge, and reverse polarity protection, allowing
it to meet stringent industrial safety regulations.
