2 x **LAN (RJ45) connectors** *(Figure 4)* provide Ethernet connectivity over standardized Ethernet cables. The integrated two-port Ethernet interface supports 
10/100/1000BASE-T/TX specifications with automatic speed negotiation and Wake on LAN (WoL) functionality. Power over Ethernet (PoE) is not supported.
