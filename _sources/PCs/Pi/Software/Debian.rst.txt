.. [#d] Chipsee uses the Raspberry official OS on the product. We add Chipsee hardware drivers to the Raspberry official system. For more information, please refer to `Industrial Pi <https://github.com/Chipsee/industrial-pi>`_.

Preparation
===========

You will need to prepare the following items before you can start using the Prebuilt Images Package to re-flash the system.

Power Supply Unit (PSU) with the appropriate voltages, as follows:

+ These products: CS10600RA070, CS10600RA4070, and CS12800RA101 requires a 6V to 36V power adapter. You must provide the power adapter since Chipsee does not ship these products with a power adapter.
+ The CS12800RA4101A RPC needs a 12V power adapter. Chipsee provides the power adapter.
+ The CS12800RA4101P RPC needs a 12V to 36V power adapter.

Software Requirements
---------------------

* |systemType| OS Prebuilt Images Package (from the link above)
* `7zip <https://www.7-zip.org/download.html>`_
* `XShell <https://xshell.en.softonic.com/>`_ or other terminal emulation software
* `VNC Viewer <https://www.realvnc.com/en/connect/download/viewer/>`_
* `BalenaEtcher <https://www.balena.io/etcher/>`_
* :download:`Rpiboot <https://github.com/raspberrypi/usbboot/raw/master/win32/rpiboot_setup.exe>`

.. note::

    * If you want to change the system, you need 7zip, a Prebuilt image, balenaEtcher, and rpiboot.
    * You can use Xshell or other terminal emulation software to debug Chipsee Raspberry Pi products in Windows.
    * You can use VNC-Viewer to control Chipsee Raspberry Pi products over Ethernet.


.. note::

    In this documentation, all the commands are executed with ``root`` user privileges.

Debug
=====

In this document, we use Xshell to debug the Chipsee Raspberry Pi products. You can also use other tools such as Putty or another terminal emulation software.
