.. centered:: **Panel Mounting**

Panel Mounting is a mounting method that mounts the product into an opening of a customer’s fixture (mounting wall) from
the front side and secures it from the rear side. All user controls are located on the rear of the mechanism,
making the panel mount displays a good choice for applications requiring a display with no external or exposed controls
such as gaming/casino system, ATM, and kiosk.

Installation Steps:

1. Put the panel mount product in the cut-out from the front side of the customer’s fixture, with the sides of the front bezel shown on the outside.

2. Use the provided mounting kits to attach and tighten the panel mount product to the customer’s fixture, as demonstrated in the figure below.

.. note::

   IP65 rated Panel PC has a special rubber on the rear of front bezel to seal the front bezel and the customer’s fixture to prevent water and dust from entering.

.. centered:: **Rear Mounting**

The rear mounting is a mounting method that mounts products from the rear side and secures them by a bracket on
the left and right sides or top and bottom sides. This method is widely used when high safety is required, for example, ATMs.

Installation Steps:

1. Screw the brackets on both sides of the rear mount product.

2. Secure the unit from the rear side of the customer’s fixture.

3. Make sure your screws are tight and in the right position, so the outer frame can be covered to ensure the safety of your display.

.. centered:: **VESA Mounting**

The VESA mounting supports a broad range of mounting options including desktop, wall, and arm mounting applications.
Most manufacturers comply with this standard by adhering to an industry wide hole pattern on the back of their displays for mounting purposes.
A typical VESA hole pattern for flat panel displays can be 75 x 75mm or 100 x 100mm.
